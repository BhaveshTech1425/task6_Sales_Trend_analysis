ðŸ“Š Sales Trend Analysis (June 2024 â€“ June 2025)

This analysis summarizes the monthly total revenue and order volume from the online_sales.orders dataset for a 13-month period. The goal is to identify peak performance, trends, and business insights using SQL aggregations.


Key Insights:

ðŸ“Œ 1. Highest Revenue Month:

June 2024 recorded the highest revenue of â‚¹30.98 lakh, despite having only 41 orders.

This implies extremely high-value purchases in that month, possibly due to a corporate order, seasonal sales, or bulk purchases.


ðŸ“Œ 2. Highest Order Volume:

July 2024 had 283 orders, the highest for the period, contributing to â‚¹2.62 crore in revenue.

This indicates a surge in customer activity, possibly due to promotions or festivals.


ðŸ“‰ 3. Lowest Performing Month:

June 2025 showed the lowest revenue (â‚¹2.02 crore) and the lowest number of orders (214).

This marks a clear year-over-year decline compared to June 2024, highlighting potential drop in demand or product mix changes.


ðŸ”„ 4. Stable Mid-Year Performance:

From August 2024 to May 2025, monthly revenue remained in a steady range of â‚¹2.0â€“2.4 crore.

Order volumes also remained consistent (between 236 and 261 orders), showing a stable customer base and consistent sales behavior.


ðŸ“ˆ 5. Decoupling of Revenue and Orders:

The data shows that higher number of orders doesnâ€™t always mean higher revenue.

Example: June 2024 had 41 orders but highest revenue.

Example: February 2025 had 236 orders but relatively lower revenue.


This suggests variability in average order value and perhaps product type or pricing strategies.
